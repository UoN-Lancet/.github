Our orgnization is a new borned student team based on University of Nottingham, focused on the **RoboMaster** competition held by **DJI**.  
We also focused on figuring technical problems that are related to robotics, including:  
  
1. Hardware Design  
2. Control Design  
3. Embedded Programming  
4. Communication Protocol Design  
5. Path Planning  
6. Decision Making  
7. Computer Vision  
  
We will public some of the repositories after we finished the developing process.  

### **IF YOU ARE THE TEAM MEMBER:**  

### ðŸ‘‰REQUIREMENTSðŸ‘ˆ  

* Create new repositories without contacting the owner is not permitted, this will cause the repository have a 'entropy increase', if you don't know where to commit your program, please contact the owners of the organization.  

* Binary files shoud not be upload to github, which will cause your repository hard to manage. To avoid this, please make sure you have [`.gitignore`](../.gitignore) file in your project befor uploading your codes.  

* Update your code if you have any changes, even if your code still have bugs to be fixed.  

* When update unstable codes and codes with error, please **do not** pull your codes to the `master` branch. Pull to the `dev` branch instead.
