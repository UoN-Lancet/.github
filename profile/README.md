### üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A short introduction  

Our organization is a newborn student team based on University of Nottingham, focused on the **RoboMaster** competition held by **DJI**.  
We also focus on figuring out technical problems that are related to robotics, including:  
  
1. Hardware Design  
2. Control Design  
3. Embedded Programming  
4. Communication Protocol Design  
5. Path Planning  
6. Decision Making  
7. Computer Vision  
  
We will publicize some of the repositories after we finished the developing process.  

### **IF YOU ARE A TEAM MEMBER:**  

What we required is:  
* Create new repositories without contacting the administrator is not permitted, this will cause the repository have an 'entropy increase', if you don't know where to commit your program, please contact the manager of the organization.  

* Binary files shoud not be upload to GitHub, (TODO: homepage in constructing)
