### **IF YOU ARE THE GUEST:**  

### 🙋‍♀️ A short introduction  

Our orgnization is a new borned student team based on University of Nottingham, focused on the **RoboMaster** competition held by **DIJ**.  
We also focused on figuring technical problems that are related to robotics, including:  
  
1. Hardware Design  
2. Control Design  
3. Embedded Programming  
4. Communication Protocol Design  
5. Path Planning  
6. Decision Making  
7. Computer Vision  
  
We will public some of the repositories after we finished the developing process.  

### **IF YOU ARE THE TEAM MEMBER:**  

What we required is:  
* Create new repositories without contacting the administritor is not permitted, this will cause the repository have a 'entropy increase', if you don't where to commit your program, please contact the manager of the organization.  

* Binary files shoud not be upload to github, (TODO: homepage in constructing)
