* Binary files shoud not be upload to github, which will cause your repository hard to manage. To avoid this, please make sure you have `.gitignore` file in your project befor uploading your codes.  

* Update your code if you have any changes, even if your code still have bugs to be fixed.  

* When update unstable codes and codes with error, please <a style="color:#FF0000">**do not**</a> pull your codes to the `master` branch. Pull your codes to the `dev` branch instead.(TODO: homepage in constructing)
